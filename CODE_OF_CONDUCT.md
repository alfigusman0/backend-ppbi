# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

In order to make clear what is expected, all contributors pledge to respect
other community members and to behave professionally. Unacceptable behavior
will not be tolerated and may result in removal from the project.

If you are reporting an incident, please contact the project maintainer: alfigusman0 via GitHub.
